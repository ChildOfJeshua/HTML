  #HTML STUDY GUIDE
    Consistent, clean, and tidy HTML code makes it easier for others to read and understand your code.

ALWAYS DECLARE DOCUMENT TYPE: Always declare the document type as the first line in your document.
<!DOCTYPE html>

Use Lowercase Element Names: Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad | Developers normally use | looks cleaner | easier to type
  <body>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>

Close All HTML Elements: In HTML, you do not have to close all elements (for example the <p> element) but looks cleaner
  <section>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </section>

Use Lowercase Attribute Names: Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad | Developers normally use | looks cleaner | easier to type
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a>

Always Quote Attribute Values: Developers normally quote | Quoted values are easier to read | You MUST use quotes if the value contains spaces
  <table class="striped">

Always Specify alt, width, and height for Images: reduces flickering, because the browser can reserve space for the image before loading
  <img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5" style="width:128px;height:128px">

Spaces and Equal Signs: But space-less is easier to read and groups entities better together.
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> vs <link rel = "stylesheet" href = "styles.css">

Avoid Long Code Lines: When using an HTML editor, it is NOT convenient to scroll right and left to read the HTML code.

Blank Lines and Indentation: 
  Do not add blank lines, spaces, or indentations without a reason.
  For readability, add blank lines to separate large or logical code blocks.
  For readability, add two spaces of indentation. Do not use the tab key.

      <body>
      
      <h1>Famous Cities</h1>
      
      <h2>Tokyo</h2>
      <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan, the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, and the most populous metropolitan area in the world.</p>
      
      <h2>London</h2>
      <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom.</p>
      
      <h2>Paris</h2>
      <p>Paris is the capital of France. The Paris area is one of the largest population centers in Europe.</p>
      
      </body>

Never Skip the <title> Element: For search engine optimization (SEO)! 

  <title>HTML Style Guide and Coding Conventions</title>

Omitting <html> and <body>?: 
  Omitting <html> and <body> can also crash DOM and XML software.
  Omitting <body> can produce errors in older browsers.

Omitting <head>?:
  Browsers will add all elements before <body>, to a default <head> element.

Close Empty HTML Elements?
    Both allowed: <meta charset="utf-8"> vs  <meta charset="utf-8" />
      If you expect XML/XHTML software to access your page, keep the closing slash (/), because it is required in XML and XHTML.

Add the lang Attribute: declare the language of the Web page | assist search engines and browsers.
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en-us">
    <head>
      <title>Page Title</title>

Meta Data: both the language and the character encoding  should be defined as early as possible in an HTML document.

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en-us">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>

Setting The Viewport: This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

HTML Comments: Short and Long Comments
    
    Short: <!-- This is a comment -->
    
    Long: 
        <!--
          This is a long comment example. This is a long comment example.
          This is a long comment example. This is a long comment example.
        -->
Using Style Sheets: Use simple syntax for linking to style sheets (the type attribute is not necessary):

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

  Short CSS rules written compressed:
    p.intro {font-family:Verdana;font-size:16em;}

  Long CSS rules written over multiple lines:
    body {
      background-color: lightgrey;
      font-family: "Arial Black", Helvetica, sans-serif;
      font-size: 16em;
      color: black;
    }

Loading JavaScript in HTML: Use simple syntax for loading external scripts (the type attribute is not necessary):
    <script src="myscript.js">

Accessing HTML Elements with JavaScript: 

    <p id="Demo">This is paragraph 1.</p>
    <p id="demo">This is paragraph 2.</p>
    
    <script>
    // Only paragraph 2 will be overwritten
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "HELLO.";
    </script>

Use Lower Case File Names:
    Some web servers (Apache, Unix) are case sensitive about file names: "london.jpg" cannot be accessed as "London.jpg"
    Other web servers (Microsoft, IIS) are not case sensitive: "london.jpg" can be accessed as "London.jpg".

File Extensions:

  HTML files should have a .html extension (.htm is allowed).
  
  CSS files should have a .css extension.
  
  JavaScript files should have a .js extension.

Differences Between .htm and .html?

  There is no difference between the .htm and .html file extensions!
  
  Both will be treated as HTML by any web browser and web server.

Default Filenames: 

  When a URL does not specify a filename at the end (like "https://www.w3schools.com/"), the server just adds a default filename,
    such as "index.html", "index.htm", "default.html", or "default.htm".
  
  If your server is configured only with "index.html" as the default filename, your file must be named "index.html", and not "default.html".
